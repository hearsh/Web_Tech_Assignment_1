## Why you picked a particular framework.

I Read a lot of documentation about React, Angular and jQuery. React was the one that I was sold to.
The fact that it was completely javaScript was something that excited me. React also offers a rich, vibrant ecosystem piggybacking on React’s de-facto standards — something the JavaScript world hasn’t seen since jQuery plugins ruled the web.

## What about that framework appealed to you?

In React, you describe what to render (instead of telling the browser how to do it). This also means that the amount of boilerplate is greatly reduced.

In React you simply start coding, it has no component boilerplate that you have to generate. There’s some setup involved, but when it comes to the components, you can express them as pure functions.

JSX in React feels just like HTML, there’s no special syntax to learn

If you know JavaScript then you can probably start writing React code in a single day.

## What alternative frameworks did you consider?

The alternative frameworks I considered are angularJs and jQuery. Angular was a bit complicated and I thought It would take 
longer to learn angularJs. With jQuery it was easy, a little to easy also I already knew a little jQuery thus I though why not learn 
something new and I choose ReactJs.

## What resources did you read/watch/listen to?

* [ReactJs](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795)
* [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Angular v ReactJs v jQuery](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-JQuery-AngularJS-and-ReactJS)
* [Angular v ReactJs v jQuery](https://www.academind.com/learn/javascript/jquery-future-angular-react-vue/)
* [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/api/)

## What kind of application did you make?

I have made a react application. It fetches data from a api end point and displays the results. It is a StarWars directory which contains information about all things StarWars.

I am using https://swapi.co/api/ to fetch data and display the types of data available, then based on the users information
it gets the data for the appropriate section. It only displays 10 records per page, the user can go next or to the previous page.

I have used the fetch api provided by javascript to get the data, the react application has no imported modules thus it is a pure application which is not dependent on any other module and can be easily deployed.

**To deploy the application navigate to the directory of the project fronm your command prompt and type 'yarn start'**
